# The Lightning Inspector

## How to run from Source

The previous builds of the Lightning Inspector are pushed in the builds directory. To use a specific version, simply follow the steps below and when asked for the directory, point it at the version in the builds directory that you wish to use. 

**You can also use "latest" to always be on the latest built and pushed version of the inspector.**

### Steps ###
* Navigate to the page chrome://extensions
* Toggle the Developer mode in the top right corner
* Click Load Unpacked Extension...
* Select the [Lightning Inspector Directory]/builds/[version||latest]


### Environment
```sh
nvm install 5.0.0       # >= 5.0.0 is ok (don't install anything with sudo)
npm install yarn -g     # install yarn package manager
```

### Setup
```sh
yarn install            # install project dependencies (and submodules)
```
### Development
```sh
yarn watch              # watches for changes in submodules
```

- **Plugin**: Open load the unpacked extension and changes should be reflected once `yarn watch` is issued

### Distribution
```sh
yarn build              # should output crx, xpi, zip files
```
